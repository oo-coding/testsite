	#this enables the rewrite engine, activates URL rewriting (like myproject.com/controller/action/1/2/3)
#    RewriteEngine on

    # is this needed, what does it do?
#    RewriteBase /   # starts at root (of this dir) and everything down from that
    #RewriteBase /pman/public/
   	#RewriteBase /pman/

# this checks for existing files, folders and links
# If the following conditions are true, then rewrite the URL:

	# If the requested filename is not a directory,
#    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

	# and if the requested filename is not a regular file that exists,
#	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

	# and if the requested filename is not a symbolic link,
#	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l

	# then rewrite the URL in the following way:  remove index.php from the request but maintain the query string
	# Take the whole request filename and provide it as the value of a
	# "url" query parameter to index.php. Append any query string from
	# the original URL as further query parameters (QSA), and stop
	# processing this .htaccess file (L).
#    RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]

    # other ways
    # RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
    # what is QSA?
    # RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?$1 [L,QSA]
